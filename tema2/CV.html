                    I am an ambitious person and eager to learn
                    as much as possible about IT. I have never worked with such a thing before
                    now, but I've been in this field since I was in high school.
                    Due to family problems, I was unable to continue my studies.
                    but that didn't stop me from researching the field.
                    That's how I came to discover these codes that I find very interesting.
                    I'm eager to learn as much as I can about codes.
